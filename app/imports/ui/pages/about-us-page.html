      <h2>The problem</h2>
      <p>ICS students often spend more time than they need on their homework and donâ€™t learn the material as effectively as they could, because they study alone and do not leverage the power of face-to-face study groups with peer mentors.</p>

      <h2>Our Solution</h2>
      <p>Study Buddy is an application for UHM ICS students to self-organize face-to-face study groups around a course and/or specific homework or project topic.</p>
